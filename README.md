# React Learning Platform

The **React Learning Platform** is a modular, multi-page website designed to provide interactive learning resources for React. It includes multiple pages such as Home, Topics, About, Demo, Testimonials, and Contact, each with a modern, responsive design. The site leverages dynamic content loading for shared header and footer components, along with interactive React demos.

---

## Features

- **Modular Design:**  
  Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for each page with shared header and footer that are dynamically loaded.

- **Interactive React Demos:**  
  Three live React demos (Counter, Toggle, and Dynamic List) that demonstrate key React concepts like state management, conditional rendering, and dynamic list rendering.

- **Responsive Layout:**  
  A design that adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Modern UI/UX:**  
  Utilizes parallax banners, glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, and hover effects for a visually appealing experience.

- **Dynamic Content Loading:**  
  Shared components (header and footer) are loaded via the Fetch API, ensuring consistency across pages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (with responsive design techniques)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **React** (loaded via CDN)
- **Babel** (for inline JSX transpilation)
- **Fetch API** (for dynamic content loading)

---

## Customization

- **Header & Footer:**  
  Modify `header.html`, `header.css`, `header.js`, and the corresponding footer files to update navigation, branding, or layout.

- **Pages:**  
  Each page (e.g., `index.html`, `topics.html`, etc.) can be customized individually. Update text, images, or interactive demos as needed.

- **React Demos:**  
  The demo page (`demo.html`) contains inline React components. You can expand or modify these components to explore additional React concepts.
